    'bio': "Hey I'm James and I have only two degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon.  After graduation from Northwestern University in 2009, I moved to New York City where I've been running an independent film finance, production and strategy company, Dogfish Pictures.  Through my company I've invested and/or produced The Romantics (2010), Salvation Boulevard (2011), Like Crazy (2011, Sundance Grand Jury Prize Winner), Vamps (2012) and Compliance (2012). <br /><br />I began attending NYU Stern fall of 2011 in order to expand my repertoire into the entrepreneurship and innovation space as well as learning practical business uses for data science.  I'm a firm believer of a scientific language within the data of indie film and am hellbent on uncovering it.  I've got some skills in Excel, financial modeling, learning basic html code (CodeYear) and have been studying lean startup practices for a good part of the last year.  Last few books I've read: Do More Faster, Venture Deals, The Founder's Dilemma, Disrupt, Co-Opetition, and A Whole New Mind.  I'm an avid coffee drinker and cartoon watcher.",

    'name': 'Arthur Loyd',
    'bio': 'I have a diverse background, specializing in venture management, law, and finance.  I have an undergrad degree in entrepreneurship from the University of Oklahoma, and have worked with several startups including in IT and non-profit.  After working for a few years I went back to school to study law and finance and have one semester left in a combined J.D./ M.S. in Finance program at the University of Tulsa.  On the legal side I have worked for the government, in private practice, and for the United Nations managing technology in the international courtroom setting (at the ICTY).  In business, I was a consultant to HR at a Fortune 200 company, where I also performed internal operational audits.  I also was a loaned executive to the United Way in Tulsa, where I managed fundraising campaigns at companies in IT and Manufacturing, raising $2.4 Million for Tulsa charities.<br /><br />I am excited to work with the Techstars Founders, helping in any way I can.  I have experience in operations, management, financial modeling, legal research, fundraising, and marketing.  I am committed to working with great companies and helping them succeed.  My hobbies include (though I never limit them) biking of any sort, soccer, snowboarding, traveling, frisbee, riding my Ducati, and just being outside.  I also love learning new languages.',

    'name': 'Eugene Wan',
    'bio': 'As a Colorado native, I have been drawn to the excitement, wealth of talent, and wonderful people that the Boulder entrepreneurial and startup scene provides. Something great is happening in Boulder - I am stoked to be in the trenches of innovation with TechStars. <br /><br />My entrance into the startup scene was through the Startup Colorado and the great work that the organization has been doing to promote entrepreneurship throughout this great state. As the Program Coordinator for Startup Summer, a novel summer program for undergraduates, I helped guide the vision of jump starting innovation at an university level, as well as handling a slew of logistics. Nothing will get you more addicted to the startup lifestyle than exposure to the community of entrepreneurs here in Boulder. <br /> I\'m a temperamental runner, an aspiring tennis player, a coffee connoisseur, and Starcraft enthusiast. Consumer electronic blogs and news sites consistently take up half my tabs in Chrome, and trust me, there\'s always a lot of tabs. I live with a constant need to improve and a greater need to innovate on that improvement, which is why I\'m here with TechStars. It\'s going to be a ridiculous summer - in the best way possible.',
